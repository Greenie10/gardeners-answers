Normally when moving wisteria, you'd dig all the way round it the year before, and then you would lift it the following year if you wanted to save it. But it's going to be a real job to lift it. Because when they're growing by a building their roots go out wide and far because it's quite dry, and so they'd be searching for moisture. If I were you I'd save all that time, I'd invest in a new one and I don't think you'll regret it. It will come into bloom quickly if you choose a good one, and you train it nicely. In the long term, it won't make that much difference.",

So you have a very large trunk, and it grows up to a certain level and they trim it to mimic the look of a tree. Â If you simply don't trim that, it turns into a very big wisteria very quickly and will give you flowers much quicker and a much more established look.",
