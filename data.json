          "It's not very old, at 75mm diameter, probably 10 years max? They do grow very fast. Normally when moving wisteria, you'd dig all the way round it the year before, and then you would lift it the following year if you wanted to save it. But it's going to be a real job to lift it. Because when they're growing by a building their roots go out wide and far because it's quite dry, and so they'd be searching for moisture. If I were you I'd save all that time, I'd invest in a new one and I don't think you'll regret it. It will come into bloom quickly if you choose a good one, and you train it nicely. In the long term, it won't make that much difference.",

          "But you've got a funny shape then, haven't you? You can't fan it out like an espalier. I would go for a little one, and then you can do the training yourself.",

          "You can buy wisteria with at least that trunk size - if not bigger - trained as a standard. They train them as if they are an artificial tree. So you have a very large trunk, and it grows up to a certain level and they trim it to mimic the look of a tree. If you simply don't trim that, it turns into a very big wisteria very quickly and will give you flowers much quicker and a much more established look."

          "You do get articles in the Press saying, this is a revolutionary new plant, which is not only going to feed the world, but is also packed full of fabulous nutrients antioxidants and all sorts of words that we've never heard of that suddenly become really important and then you realize that the people who are actually sponsoring that are the Breeders who were trying to get us to grow that type of plant. The second thing is if you want to go down that route of one of the more alternative grains one of the more alternative seeds then Amaranth is definitely much easier than something like quinoa because amaranth produces a whole host of seeds, which are very easy to extract in fact with a little bit of sunshine and a warm afternoon by the time you've cut the stems the seeds are all literally falling out of the the fading flowers, so that is a great plan and you can use that in exactly the same way pretty much as quinoa, and it has many of the same beneficial properties, so not only does it look great because it's a much more attractive plant but much easier to harvest too.",

          "Bear in mind nobody grew sweet corn in this country north of Watford until after the early seventies and then the breeding completely changed, and now we all grow sweet corn and it's really easy. Wasn't there something in the news recently that this is the new super plant that's going to feed the world and it's really healthy. I'd let the plant breeders do a bit more work, but I'm glad you've tried because I won't bother now!",

I'm not being rude, but yes, frankly, I'm not even going to try. You can feel disaster and waste of good growing land coming as soon as you read about it. It wasn't designed to grow here, and you can fidget things about a bit improve conditions and have good years for all sorts of things that weren't naturally going to be here, but sometimes I think you're pushing your luck if you want to get something worthwhile per square yard."

          "Yes where you address that it always seems counterintuitive isn't it because you need to prune that one where it's the side where it's not growing so well slightly harder because obviously by pruning something you're encouraging it to shoot more and grow so that's my first point of action if you want to even it up a bit and now you see it is amazing as a flower arrangement for the Christmas period so I would be tempted to pull a few out now because they're quite useful to have indoors. LIke your husband I think they're nice just growing  massive and big and that the slight downside is if you do tend to prune them back too hard you can encourage just ordinary forms to grow up, which you don't want now. so  I would tend to  prune it a bit in the summer because that way that you're not going to encourage massive more vegetative growth, and then you can also see what you're doing and it's much easier to not make a mess of it, I think.

          "It is a lovely plant though, and I have to say it's at its best when you're standing underneath it looking through those twisted stems, and the whole distorted and contorted canopy. I think is absolutely magical it's worth remembering that the story in terms of how it came into our Gardens is that it was an apparently drunken vicar who was on his way on his bicycle to deliver a sermon. So drunk he fell into the Hedge and happened to see a Hazel which was twisted and contorted and apparently he took the cutting from it and grew it on and that's how it found its way into our Gardens, so it's a it's the result of a drunken Reverend, but they don't they they don't like heavy pruning if you do heavy prune them, then you will get into a battle with all the suckers coming up from the base. To be honest I would much rather especially this time of the year when they're devoid of any foliage put a light underneath it and allow that light to shine up through the canopy so from ground level shine up through the canopy especially if you've got a wall or other trees behind that where you can see the shadowing and it becomes fabulously sculptural during the winter months. It really is a super super plant."

And other half Isn't So keen - he thinks they should grow to their natural height and breadth, and I feel it should be kept a bit lower a bit more restricted.  We have an added problem that where it's planted in the garden, it gets more light on one particular side so one side looks particularly bare at times."

        "Bunny": "Unless you've got pigs of course my pigs love banana skins!",
        "Chris":
          "Well, there's no doubt that you know banana skins, it's an organic matter so the organic matter itself is going to be beneficial in terms of improving soil structure holding the soil particles apart increasing water holding capacity increasing the capacity of the the soil to hold onto plant nutrients, and then of course you have the nutrient status of the banana skins themselves which once the banana skin has broken down in the soil, that could be made available to the plants around which you're scattering your banana skins So in theory:  absolutely, scatter your banana skins with gay abandon across the site and see what the consequences are. To be honest you're probably better off putting it on the compost heap allowing it to rot down in a much more stable environment where the nutrients as the skin breaks down are then locked into the compost rather than the nutrients becoming soluble in water and then swilling out of the soil before the plants have even got a chance to grab them as they as they pass their roots, that would be a much better process so the theory absolutely. The effort required to put one banana skin around or underneath the roots of every single ornamental plant?  Probably not worth it. So put it on your compost heap. You would have to eat an awful lot of bananas in order to keep every plant in the garden happy, but, if you eat that many bananas keep chucking them on the compost heap. You only have to bite into a banana to open it - so rather than cracking it open with your fingers you bite into it, it has an incredibly drying taste, and I suspect that it's an alkaline actually that's in there which the function of that chemical base is to prevent anything rotting it down or breaking into it and eating it so actually you have to break down the deterrent which is inherent in the plant in order to get access to any benefits that it has, and that's why the compost heap is the way forward",

          "This is to Dracaena isn't it the dragon tree, and I found them one of the easiest house plants to keep and grow they don't mind central heating too much. Is it a heated conservatory?  [There are a couple of Radiators, but not overheated.] Because a lot of houseplants hate our dry conditions.  A room for people is not a room for plants because they don't like dry conditions, but dracaena in my experience, you can't really kill it. You know give it a good water in once a week keep on top of that  bugs and give it a feed in the spring and potting on as necessary, and they grow massive that they will grow into a tree, but maybe that's what you probably want that!",
        "Pippa":
          "It sounds like mealybug mealy bug is a very common pest of houseplants, conservatory plants and so forth because it wouldn't basically survive our British Winters, and if you look really closely at these  little tiny clutches of cotton wool, but if you look really closely you'll see numerous often clustered together grayish pinky tiny creatures that look almost like miniature miniature versions of wood lice they've got a sort of ribbed body. You need to look for those, and they cover themselves in these white waxy fibers basically as a protection mechanism and also  so they don't look very appetizing and they don't look like a little critter that might be worth eating and because it's waxy, it also sheds rain or any attempts at spraying them as well. They suck the plant's sap so they can do quite a lot of damage in with something like cacti for instance if you've got any cacti they can suck them dry very very quickly and and kill off the whole thing so I would get control of them. There are a couple of things you can do first of all you can introduce an Australian ladybird called crypto lemus which both that and its young and the young rather unfortunately looks nothing like a ladybird relative, but very much like a massive mealy, bug and they're both really voracious predators of the mealybug, and they will literally seek out and find and eat them having said that it's the least well-behaved of all the biological controls, and it does have a bit of a tendency to wander off so what you could do is get some of  them introduce them to the plant and then enclose the whole thing in a piece of fleece or fleece jacket or something a bit like when you have a new cat you're meant to keep it inside for a couple of weeks to sort of tell it where it's meant to be. The other option and what a lot of people do and of course -  I'm not actively recommending this -  I'm just telling you what other people do is to use a fairly strong alcohol so a spirit some people try out with things like methylated Spirit some people get given bottles of things like whiskey  - they don't enjoy drinking whiskey on the end of a cotton bud, and the alcohol will actually eat into the waxy coating on the mealybug and kill them off in that way, but you do need to do repeated attacks with whatever you're doing that with if you were to decide to do that.
